    "I understand that program works on a very basic level and with many limitations:\n",
    "1. There are only two ways user can interact with the bot;\n",
    "2. When user calls \"/start\" command twice or more, program stops;\n",
    "3. I believe, there is much more better way to send message automatically than using \"while\" and \"time.sleep\" functions;\n",
    "4. As for me, parser or database recorder doesn't work properly, that's why there are problems with comparison of values and updating them in database;\n",
    "5. Program doesn't work in standalone mode, because I didn't deploy it on server (Heroku, by instance)\n",
    "5. ... (there're some I couldn's see/understend).\n",
    "\n",
    "As I said, task was challenging for me, particularly when I didn't know why on some of the steps the program didn't work. For example, I thought that it's possible to save the latest exchange rate showed to user without database, just with dictionary. And I spent quite much time looking for or thinking about the solution. After all, I reread the task and realized that when there was \"data storage\" keyword in it, then I was inventing a bicycle. When I used database to solve the issue, the program, by halves, started to work the way it should.<br />\n",
    "Such challenges weren't uncommon, but it gave me a lot of lessons:\n",
    "1. The problem/situation/task doesn't look so challenging if it's divided on small objects;\n",
    "2. The better you search, the faster you find/come up with the solution. For the better search, high-quality questions needed. Such questions are possible when you look at the problem from different angles.\n",
    "3. It's always make sense to visualise the problem.\n",
    "4. Every API has a documentation with pretty clear explanatory text, but it often shows common examples (I don't know, maybe in other documentations it's not so) and for a deeper understanding you need to search.\n",
    "5. Never give up on the task.\n",
    "6. If you gave up, remember that actually you didn't.\n",
    "7. If you gave up for the third time - take a break.\n",
    "8. Rest helps with solving the problem.\n",
    "9. Programming is a very hard work, when you don't have technical background and mentor. Actually, it's one of the greatest resons I've not completed the task. But it's possible to learn programming with the proper motivation and desire.\n",
    "10. ... (and also a lot of different stuff related to code, databases, syntax etc.)\n",
